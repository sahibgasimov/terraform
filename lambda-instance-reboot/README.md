# EC2 Reboot Scheduler with SNS Notifications

This project leverages Terraform to automate the rebooting of an AWS EC2 instance every Friday at 20:00 pm EST and subsequently sends an SNS notification about the reboot event.

## üõ† Components

- **AWS Lambda**: Executes the Python script to reboot the specified EC2 instance and send an SNS notification.
- **Amazon SNS Topic**: Dispatches notifications upon the reboot of the EC2 instance.
- **AWS CloudWatch Events**: Scheduled to invoke the Lambda function every Friday at 20:00 pm EST.
- **IAM Role and Policy**: Grants the Lambda function the required permissions to reboot the EC2 instance and send SNS notifications.

## üîç Prerequisites

- An active AWS account.
- [Terraform](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/terraform/install-cli) installation.
- AWS CLI set up with the necessary credentials.

## üöÄ Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone [YOUR_REPOSITORY_URL]
   cd [YOUR_REPOSITORY_DIRECTORY]


Configuration:

Update the Terraform file, substituting placeholders (your-region, your-account-id, your-instance-id) with the appropriate values.
Modify handler.py, updating 'YOUR_INSTANCE_ID' with the ID of your EC2 instance.

Prepare the Lambda Package:

zip lambda_package.zip handler.py

Initialize and Deploy with Terraform:

terraform init
terraform plan
terraform apply

Validation:

Inspect the CloudWatch Events rule to confirm its schedule.
Manually trigger the Lambda function via the AWS Lambda console to verify its operation.
üïµÔ∏è Troubleshooting
For diagnostic information, refer to CloudWatch Logs located under the /aws/lambda/rebootEC2AndNotify log group.

üßπ Cleanup
To prevent incurring superfluous charges on AWS:

terraform destroy


This command deletes all resources instantiated by the Terraform script.

This structure, now enhanced with emojis and improved formatting, can be copied and pasted directly into your `README.md` file. Make sure to replace placeholders such as `[YOUR_REPOSITORY_URL]` and `[YOUR_REPOSITORY_DIRECTORY]` with your specific information.


## Steps to create the Lambda package:

Write the Python code in a file named handler.py.
Zip the file: zip lambda_package.zip handler.py
Use this lambda_package.zip in the Terraform configuration.# lambda_ec2_reboot
